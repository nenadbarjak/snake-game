# SNAKE GAME

## Snake game made with HTML, Canvas and JavaScript

## How to play
Use arrow keys or WASD keys to control the snake, SPACE to play/pause and ESC to quit.  
Snake dies when coliding with a wall or it self.  
Player can set the speed of the snake and choose one of three walls levels before the game.  
When the snake eats a fruit, it increases in size by one square.  
Every 15 fruits eaten, the snake will return to its original size of 3 squares and the walls level will increase by 1.  
The snake will freeze for 3 seconds during that time so the player can change direction and avoid newly formed walls.  
An apple is worth 1 point. Sometimes, a banana which is worth 2 points will pop up randomly instead.  
Scores are tracked and best 3 scores are automatically shown on the scoreboard.
